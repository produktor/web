Preparation and formation of the final business plan is planned for the first quarter of 2022. Below is the structure of the initial investments (seed investments) required to start the project and its further development. The total initial investment for 2022 will be 738,000 USD . The approximate distribution of investment costs is shown below: Investments for Q1/22: \u00b6 Amount: 135,000 USD Investments for Q2/22: \u00b6 Amount: 181,000 USD Investments for Q3/22: \u00b6 Amount: 212,000 USD Investments for Q4/22: \u00b6 Amount: 205,000 USD Investment Model and Initial Tokenomics Calculations \u00b6 During the seed round of the investment round, potential investors are offered the model described below. Primary calculations of tokenomics of the project \u00b6 The project is supposed to issue its own token, which is mixed in nature: The native project token will allow its owner to use it to purchase services (extended functionality, extended technical support, extended subscriptions, etc.) provided directly by the development team and project support team; The native project token will act as an internal contractual means of exchange, allowing its owners to use it to purchase goods/services offered by other project users; Native token of the project will be put on different cryptocurrency exchanges during the ITO, which will allow its owners to profit from its sale in the future with a guaranteed retention of the token price by the project team during the term determined by the ITO program. A deflationary ITO model is envisaged, where the issuance is limited to a certain number of tokens. During the first year of the project's activity, the tokens transferred to investors will be stored by them without the possibility of realization on existing cryptocurrency platforms. In addition, preseed- and seed-stage investors will be guaranteed the right to an advisory vote in the elaboration of the main strategic directions of project development, the development of the project's tokenomics, the elaboration of the project's business plan and financial models. The investors will retain this right until the end of HT according to the issuance scheme. Preliminary investment model \u00b6 Due to the choice of a deflationary ITO model, the following preliminary issuance scheme is assumed: TS (Total Supply) - The total volume of issuance, is 4.000.000 tokens; IP (Initial Price) - initial rate of the token, determined during the issuance and fixed in the smart contract, is 1.00 euros per token; HT (Hold Time) - mandatory period of token holding by the investor, is 3 months from the moment the token is placed on the exchange. During HT, smart contracts will provide investors with additional remuneration in the amount of 0.85% of the total number of tokens for the month (2.65% for the whole HT), remuneration will be paid at the end of HT in project tokens; GMP (Guaranteed Market Price) - set exclusively for the purpose of guaranteeing the interests of investors at the preseed and seed stages. From the moment the token is listed on exchanges and HT ends, smart contracts will stipulate that the project will maintain a mandatory price of \u20ac2.00 per token, which will give investors the opportunity to return their investment at a rate of 100% without regard to inflation rates. The project envisages directing 20% of the total token issue to be deposited on exchanges to provide \"repurchases\" of the token at times of sale at a price lower than the stated price for GMP. To bring the project to ITO and listing tokens on exchanges, a preliminary calculation of the distribution of the issue will be as follows: At the end of HT and the GMP retention period, the value of the token will be determined solely by the development of the project and market performance.","title":"Plan"},{"location":"project/business-plan/#initial-calculation-of-project-feasibility","text":"When studying existing markets and platforms with similar functionality to Produktor.io , the developers came to the following conclusions:","title":"Initial calculation of project feasibility"},{"location":"project/business-plan/#pricing-model","text":"As conceived by the developers, the main income items from the operation of the application will be formed as follows: The following is a description of the basic functionality of the application, as well as the advanced functionality provided to paid categories of users.

During HT, smart contracts will provide investors with additional remuneration in the amount of 0.85% of the total number of tokens for the month (2.65% for the whole HT), remuneration will be paid at the end of HT in project tokens; GMP (Guaranteed Market Price) - set exclusively for the purpose of guaranteeing the interests of investors at the preseed and seed stages.

It is clear that the consequences of the war in Ukraine will be catastrophic at worldwide level, accelerating the collapse of the current banking, financial, administrative systems, supply chain, etc. In any case, it is already clear that this is already hitting ordinary people, and will hit even harder. Communication is disrupted, the economic downturn makes it difficult to make settlements and receive cash, and the cash received quickly depreciates in value. It is also important to note that over the past two months, many representatives of the IT sector who have been directly affected by the dire circumstances of today have joined the project team. With initial investment, current project participants can form a truly effective team that can make a significant impact on the implementation of the original roadmap For the above reasons, the project team made an important decision. Since it is not possible to guarantee monetization of the project in the directions, volumes and conditions specified in the plan, in the current circumstances, we make changes in the order of attracting investment. We will raise funds for the development of the project on terms close to those of impact investment. We warn investors in advance that we do not have the right to guarantee the possibility of development of the project and its full 100%, as unstable political and economic situation in the world excludes the possibility of accurate predictions. We believe that a fast launch of the project would not only allow the exchange of goods and provide an opportunity to buy and sell goods and services in the absence / poor functioning of the Internet, the failure of the banking system, thereby allowing to start generating income from the project, but would also give impetus to social interaction between people, providing them with the opportunity to share information, to organize and coordinate assistance to each other. Your investment will let us to financially support many developers, programmers, designers who wish to join the Produktor.io team, but do not have such an opportunity due to the need to look for ways of financial survival in the new conditions. Expanding the project team, in turn, will ensure its speedy finalization and launch in a test version. Further development of the project and the expansion of its functionality will be carried out during the operation of the beta-version of the product. All this will allow the project to return as quickly as possible to the original roadmap , even with forced changes, and to the originally planned investment scheme We accept contributions to the project, starting from 100 (ONE HUNDRED) euros.

A decentralized Internet that is not subject to control and censorship will inevitably allow the creation of ever better content and offer ever-increasing quality of services. One of the interesting projects aimed at the practical implementation of the Web 3.0 concept was OpenBazaar, created in 2014. The project involved the creation of a decentralized platform allowing users to engage in online commerce using BTC. An impressive community was formed around the project; by mid-2016, the project had more than 100,000 downloaded participants, and the service itself won three BlockchainAwards-2016 nominations - \"Most Promising User Application,\" \"Best New Startup\" and \"Bitcoin Champion of the Year. However, despite the growing number of users (the OpenBazaar software was eventually installed more than 250,000 times), the service was subsequently discontinued for reasons unrelated to the decline in user interest (to this day, the user community is asking questions about the timing of resuming the service, or launching a similar one). As one of OpenBazaar co-founders Brian Hoffman said in his interview to the Coindesk platform: ...As for why OpenBazaar has not become widespread, there are countless possible reasons. The biggest one I can point to is that cryptocurrency, bitcoin in particular, went from being a cheap alternative to cash to a store of value - digital gold - which was not conducive to everyday shopping in e-commerce like Amazon. When Ethereum came along and took the bulk of the dapp from bitcoin, we were hesitant to join its board. I'm not sure it would have helped us, because so far no Ethereum-based alternative to OpenBazaar has emerged that has gotten much traction. Most of them have switched to selling only digital goods or unplayable tokens, which are much better suited to the instantaneous nature of cryptocurrency. The aforementioned factors persist at the present time, and the degree of their influence on user sentiment is also growing. At the same time, the platform that could occupy the OpenBazaar niche does not exist to this day, and the created (even if not fully advertised) niche in the modern market remains unoccupied. At the same time, the last two years have seen a steady increase in the interest of the average consumer in the C2C sector. As follows from the analysis conducted by the [CROSS-BORDER] platform ( https://www.cbcommerce.eu ) The total turnover of the cross-border e-commerce market in Europe, including the UK, Switzerland and Norway, is \u20ac198.5 billion in 2020 (excluding travel costs), of which \u20ac115.4 billion, or 58%, comes from trading platforms. Amazon and eBay have the lion's share of the market, with expected turnover of \u20ac44.3 billion and \u20ac22.8 billion in 2020, more than half the market. The turnover of the top 100 cross-border trading platforms in Europe reaches 100 billion euros. During the COVID-19 pandemic, trading platforms grew by 37.5% at the expense of C2C trading platforms. This growth is expected to continue and. to reach 65% of cross-border online sales in Europe by 2025 Thus, the emergence of a complete platform in the sector that meets the needs of users in terms of security, reliability, speed of transactions and accessibility will inevitably attract to its use the ever-increasing percentage of customers who focus primarily on e-commerce and C2C business models. Product description \u00b6 Produktor.io is a mobile application based on a proprietary mapping service. The app is designed to facilitate C2C communication for users by enabling them to either directly exchange goods/services, or to do so using cryptocurrencies as an intermediate exchange asset or a LOCAL equivalent of a payment instrument. The idea of the application emerged as a reaction to the analysis of existing markets and their drawbacks (see Introduction). Both the disadvantages associated with the overall centralized structure of markets and the integration of crypto-assets into global market processes were analyzed. Issues under consideration and ways to solve them \u00b6 From the developers point of view, the main drawbacks of the existing markets of turnover of goods (turnover of services) at the level of private users and small businesses can be identified as the following: Communication instability \u00b6 Lack of unified norms of interpretation of laws and rules, technical problems of modern networks, increasing degree of state interference in market processes, other well-known problems of centralized systems. Communicational instability, in its turn, leads to very negative consequences, limiting the potential of the existing system for further development - reduction of users' trust in the platforms providing services of exchange and purchase/sale of goods and services, accumulation of technical errors, which inevitably lead to malfunction of the existing systems, supply chain disorders, the need to use the services of a vast class of intermediaries (lawyers, notaries, banks, courts), especially in case of different kinds of problems, the need to use the services of the intermediaries of the existing systems. High taxes and strict regulation in commodity turnover \u00b6 Participation of small and medium businesses in commodity exchange operations results in inclusion by their representatives in the price of such goods of amounts of taxes and fees affecting ultimately the price of goods/services for the end consumer. As for participation of individuals in this sector, their activities are seriously restricted at the legislative level - exceeding the volume of transactions or limits of money turnover may lead to the procedure of recognizing such a market participant as a person in the status of entrepreneur without appropriate registration, with all the legal consequences arising from this. Excessive presence of intermediaries in the market \u00b6 In the existing system, based on centralized regulation and control, there is a large layer of persons providing the widest range of services that can be conditionally referred to the class of intermediaries. It is impossible to make payments without using the modern banking system as an intermediary, it is often necessary to go through special registration procedures to participate in full-fledged barter transactions, and the emergence of disputes and differences in the terms of contracts and agreements causes the involvement of additional actors in the relationship between the parties to the transaction - lawyers, escrow agents, notaries, the courts. Growing number of crypto-asset holders with limited ability to fully use them \u00b6 In recent years, the number of Internet users, somehow connected with cryptocurrencies, is constantly growing.

From there we have defined our main objectives","title":"Idea"},{"location":"project/product_idea/#development-of-the-idea","text":"Interest in platforms that provide the greatest degree of interaction of users with each other and with the world around them emerged a long time ago and was developed in the formation of the concept of Web 3.0. A decentralized Internet that is not subject to control and censorship will inevitably allow the creation of ever better content and offer ever-increasing quality of services. One of the interesting projects aimed at the practical implementation of the Web 3.0 concept was OpenBazaar, created in 2014. The project involved the creation of a decentralized platform allowing users to engage in online commerce using BTC. An impressive community was formed around the project; by mid-2016, the project had more than 100,000 downloaded participants, and the service itself won three BlockchainAwards-2016 nominations - \"Most Promising User Application,\" \"Best New Startup\" and \"Bitcoin Champion of the Year. However, despite the growing number of users (the OpenBazaar software was eventually installed more than 250,000 times), the service was subsequently discontinued for reasons unrelated to the decline in user interest (to this day, the user community is asking questions about the timing of resuming the service, or launching a similar one). As one of OpenBazaar co-founders Brian Hoffman said in his interview to the Coindesk platform: ...As for why OpenBazaar has not become widespread, there are countless possible reasons. The biggest one I can point to is that cryptocurrency, bitcoin in particular, went from being a cheap alternative to cash to a store of value - digital gold - which was not conducive to everyday shopping in e-commerce like Amazon. When Ethereum came along and took the bulk of the dapp from bitcoin, we were hesitant to join its board. I'm not sure it would have helped us, because so far no Ethereum-based alternative to OpenBazaar has emerged that has gotten much traction. Most of them have switched to selling only digital goods or unplayable tokens, which are much better suited to the instantaneous nature of cryptocurrency. The aforementioned factors persist at the present time, and the degree of their influence on user sentiment is also growing. At the same time, the platform that could occupy the OpenBazaar niche does not exist to this day, and the created (even if not fully advertised) niche in the modern market remains unoccupied. At the same time, the last two years have seen a steady increase in the interest of the average consumer in the C2C sector. As follows from the analysis conducted by the [CROSS-BORDER] platform ( https://www.cbcommerce.eu ) The total turnover of the cross-border e-commerce market in Europe, including the UK, Switzerland and Norway, is \u20ac198.5 billion in 2020 (excluding travel costs), of which \u20ac115.4 billion, or 58%, comes from trading platforms. Amazon and eBay have the lion's share of the market, with expected turnover of \u20ac44.3 billion and \u20ac22.8 billion in 2020, more than half the market. The turnover of the top 100 cross-border trading platforms in Europe reaches 100 billion euros. During the COVID-19 pandemic, trading platforms grew by 37.5% at the expense of C2C trading platforms. This growth is expected to continue and. to reach 65% of cross-border online sales in Europe by 2025 Thus, the emergence of a complete platform in the sector that meets the needs of users in terms of security, reliability, speed of transactions and accessibility will inevitably attract to its use the ever-increasing percentage of customers who focus primarily on e-commerce and C2C business models.","title":"Development of the idea"},{"location":"project/product_idea/#product-description","text":"Produktor.io is a mobile application based on a proprietary mapping service.
