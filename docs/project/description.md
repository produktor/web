# Description

[Produktor.io](https://produktor.io) is a mobile application based on a proprietary mapping service. The app is designed
to facilitate C2C communication for users by enabling them to either directly exchange goods/services, or to do so using
cryptocurrencies as an intermediate exchange asset or a LOCAL equivalent of a payment instrument.

The idea of the application emerged as a reaction to the analysis of existing markets and their drawbacks (see
Introduction). Both the disadvantages associated with the overall centralized structure of markets and the integration
of crypto-assets into global market processes were analyzed.
