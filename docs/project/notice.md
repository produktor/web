# IMPORTANT CHANGES TO INITIAL PLAN

Due to the fact that the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 were marked by a series of events that led to unforeseen changes in the world situation, it is impossible for us to predict the behavior of the global economic and financial system, as well as its prospects in the current form. 

It is clear that the consequences of the war in Ukraine will be catastrophic at worldwide level, accelerating the collapse of the current banking, financial, administrative systems, supply chain, etc. 

In any case, it is already clear that this is already hitting ordinary people, and will hit even harder. Communication is disrupted, the economic downturn makes it difficult to make settlements and receive cash, and the cash received quickly depreciates in value. 

It is also important to note that over the past two months, many representatives of the IT sector who have been directly affected by the dire circumstances of today have joined the project team. With initial investment, current project participants can form a truly effective team that can make a significant impact on the implementation of the original [roadmap](road_map.md)

#### For the above reasons, the project team made an important decision. Since it is not possible to guarantee monetization of the project in the directions, volumes and conditions specified in the plan, in the current circumstances, we make changes in the order of attracting investment.

We will raise funds for the development of the project on terms close to those of impact investment. We warn investors in advance that we do not have the right to guarantee the possibility of development of the project and its full 100%, as unstable political and economic situation in the world excludes the possibility of accurate predictions. We believe that a fast launch of the project would not only allow the exchange of goods and provide an opportunity to buy and sell goods and services in the absence / poor functioning of the Internet, the failure of the banking system, thereby allowing  to start generating income from the project, but would also give impetus to social interaction between people, providing them with the opportunity to share information, to organize and coordinate assistance to each other. 

Your investment will let us to financially support many developers, programmers, designers who wish to join the [Produktor.io]() team, but do not have such an opportunity due to the need to look for ways of financial survival in the new conditions. Expanding the project team, in turn, will ensure its speedy finalization and launch in a test version. Further development of the project and the expansion of its functionality will be carried out during the operation of the beta-version of the product. 

All this will allow the project to return as quickly as possible to the original [roadmap](road_map.md), even with forced changes, and to the originally planned [investment scheme](business_plan.md)

We accept contributions to the project, starting from 100 (ONE HUNDRED) euros. We soberly assess the circumstances and understand that work on the project can be resumed only with a minimum fund of 5.000 (FIVE THOUSANDS) euros. 

#### For contributions in BTC: 

#### For contributions in ETH:

For all who wish to support the project with a bigger amount, starting from 5.000 (FIVE THOUSAND) Euro, we guarantee in case of launching the project the return on investment scheme outlined in the original financial plan (see **Investment Model and Initial Tokenomics Calculations** setion of [financial plan](business_plan.md)
