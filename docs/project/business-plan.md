## Initial calculation of project feasibility

When studying existing markets and platforms with similar functionality to [Produktor.io](), the developers came to the following conclusions:

### Pricing model

As conceived by the developers, the main income items from the operation of the application will be formed as follows:

The following is a description of the basic functionality of the application, as well as the advanced functionality provided to paid categories of users.

According to the proposed business model, the main income items of the project will be:

#### Fees

Transaction fees (thanks to a number of innovative technical solutions in blockchain, the application is able to perform transactions with minimal fees for the end user, which is one oc

#### Markets supply

Implementation of data about demand/supply on markets, data about geographical and temporal distribution of user requests, other statistical information obtained from collection and analysis of data about application users' activity.

#### Advertising

Placement of paid advertising content.


#### Advanced functionality

Registration of paid users with access to the application's extended functionality.

#### Enterprise support

Providing users with extended technical support services.

### Approximate distribution

The avg. distribution of future revenues by source of monetization:

Normal registration in the application (for all categories of users during the beta-testing period, for free accounts - after the full launch of the application) will give the user access to basic functionality, which includes the following features:

* Placement of information about offered goods/services.
* The system of determining the approximate price by searching for similar goods/services on the Internet and determining the average price indicators.
* Ability to identify goods by the following parameters:
  * ISDN.
  * Use of AI to identify goods/products by a photo taken by a user's smartphone camera.
  * Barcode.
  * QR-Code.
  * Through text analysis using OCR.
* Providing exchange of goods/services for crypto-assets:
  * Creating a transaction containing complete product/service information.
  * Distributed storage of information about the product/service and places of demand, as well as places of exchange, Accumulating information to analyze and understand markets
  * Maintenance of transactions through smart contracts.
* Performing product searches by category, globally on a map, or with preset search areas.
* Access to logistics services of specialized companies (locally and globally), without users without paying any additional fees.
* Management of cold wallets for the purpose of storage and exchange of crypto-assets by the user.

At the same time, in order to comply with current legislation, the application does not provide its own cold wallets, but only provides users with the ability to connect and use their wallets.

In the extended functionality, which the user is supposed to have access to, interaction with investors, sponsors, partners, negotiations, signing agreements and contracts.

* Project Manager support.
* Presentation of the project.
* preparation and signing of necessary investment agreements - in the interaction with the copywriter with paid accounts after the end of the beta-testing period, the following features are provided:

  * Automatic registration and storage of data on all performed transactions.
  * The possibility of automatic drawing up and keeping of accounting documents on the basis of data on operations, including automatic issuing of invoices on the fact of sales, automatic numbering of invoices, automatic registration of returns/replacement of goods.
  * Automatic preparation of tax reports on the basis of the automatic accounting data, enabling the user to make modifications in the manual mode.
  * **Important:** For users of their EU in the future you should also allow guest access to accounting data with commenting and approval rights - given the prevalence of hiring external accountants and tax advisers even at the private level, such an option will allow users to remain confident that their accounts are audited by their own advisers. Additionally, it will provide the application team with a reason to shift final responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of tax information to such
    consultants.
  * Enhanced market analysis capabilities.

>It is planned to introduce several levels of paid use, each of which will include all the functionality of the previous level plus extended functions or expanded scope of technical support.

### Investment Model and Initial Tokenomics Calculations

During the seed round of the investment round, potential investors are offered the model described below.

#### Primary calculations of tokenomics of the project

The project is supposed to issue its own token, which is mixed in nature:

- The native project token will allow its owner to use it to purchase services (extended functionality, extended technical support, extended subscriptions, etc.) provided directly by the development team and project support team;
- The native project token will act as an internal contractual means of exchange, allowing its owners to use it to purchase goods/services offered by other project users;
- Native token of the project will be put on different cryptocurrency exchanges during the ITO, which will allow its owners to profit from its sale in the future with a guaranteed retention of the token price by the project team during the term determined by the ITO program.

A deflationary ITO model is envisaged, where the issuance is limited to a certain number of tokens.

During the first year of the project's activity, the tokens transferred to investors will be stored by them without the possibility of realization on existing cryptocurrency platforms. In addition, preseed- and seed-stage investors will be guaranteed the right to an advisory vote in the elaboration of the main strategic directions of project development, the development of the project's tokenomics, the elaboration of the project's business plan and financial models. The investors will retain this right until the end of HT according to the issuance scheme.

#### Preliminary investment model

Due to the choice of a deflationary ITO model, the following preliminary issuance scheme is assumed:

- **TS (Total Supply)** - The total volume of issuance, is 4.000.000 tokens;
- **IP (Initial Price)** - initial rate of the token, determined during the issuance and fixed in the smart contract, is 1.00 euros per token;
- **HT (Hold Time)** - mandatory period of token holding by the investor, is 3 months from the moment the token is placed on the exchange. During HT, smart contracts will provide investors with additional remuneration in the amount of 0.85% of the total number of tokens for the month (2.65% for the whole HT), remuneration will be paid at the end of HT in project tokens;
- **GMP (Guaranteed Market Price)** - set exclusively for the purpose of guaranteeing the interests of investors at the preseed and seed stages. From the moment the token is listed on exchanges and HT ends, smart contracts will stipulate that the project will maintain a mandatory price of €2.00 per token, which will give investors the opportunity to return their investment at a rate of 100% without regard to inflation rates. The project envisages directing 20% of the total token issue to be deposited on exchanges to provide "repurchases" of the token at times of sale at a price lower than the stated price for GMP.

To bring the project to ITO and listing tokens on exchanges, a preliminary calculation of the distribution of the issue will be as follows:


![](assets/diagrams/Total%20supply.svg)

At the end of HT and the GMP retention period, the value of the token will be determined solely by the development of the project and market performance.
