# Produktor Business Plan

The recession in which the modern world finds itself is globally recognized as the most severe in the last 90 years. The stratification of society, the deep economic crisis and the crisis of the functioning of markets, the growing interference of states and interstate associations in the daily life of individuals - these are not all the negative effects of the rapid technological, informational development, as well as the existing pandemic that we can observe.

Under these conditions, we can note the global trend of ordinary users to use those mechanisms and tools when participating in markets (by this we mean not only trading or investing, but also the daily processes of buying/selling goods and services), which allow:

* reduce the number of procedures and intermediaries required to complete a transaction between buyer and seller.
* provide the user with more anonymity and better protection of their data.
* in general, provide the user with a greater number of options to ensure the safety of his funds and protect them from inflationary processes.

Back in 1989, the company [DigiCash](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiCash) launched a digital cash system with anonymous transactions. Subsequently, this company ceased its activities, including due to a possible too early entry into the market.

In 1997, Adam Beck proposes a concept he developed [Hashcash](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash), which is essentially one of the prototypes of the Bitcoin protocol. The Hashcash algorithm is a Proof-of-Work system and was designed to reduce spam and DoS attacks.

In 2009, someone named Satoshi Nakamoto publishes the Bitcoin Whitepaper, in which he describes the principles of a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system. From this moment, we can start counting the full history of cryptocurrencies.

As of the end of 2021, there are more than 11,000 different cryptocurrencies in the world. The capitalization of various cryptocurrencies on the market varies from millions to hundreds of billions of dollars, the number of market users and the number of transactions in the networks is steadily growing.

Increase in the number of transactions in the Bitcoin network.




The potential of cryptocurrencies based on decentralized systems and technologies to solve the problems of the centralized global market is undeniable, and this is confirmed by the steadily growing level of people's trust in this type of asset. Nevertheless, for all the development of technology, crypto-assets have not yet been fully integrated into the market sphere.

If we talk about modern markets, in one way or another related to cryptocurrencies, we can identify a number of key issues of paramount importance to the user.



# Current situation analysis

A lot of cryptocurrency projects provide one way or another the possibility to exchange the specified assets, but at the same time do not provide users with the possibility to use crypto-assets as an equivalent local means of payment/asset for intermediate exchange and expression of value of goods/services.

The existing applications do not take into account the need to keep records of acquisitions and sales, users do not have the ability to record information about transactions in a certain format in order to generate a service reporting documentation, which closes the access to the use of such applications by users in the status of a business entity.

The majority of users wishing to place a product/service for sale on the Internet face difficulties already at the initial stage:

* The **complexity of procedures** for specifying information about the product/service, description, uploading images.

* **Difficulties in price finding** due to the absence of price analysis mechanisms.

* The **complexity of ensuring control** over the execution of the terms of transactions, the presence of the risk of default by the parties to the transaction.

To ensure the reliability of transactions, it is often necessary to involve intermediaries - banks, notaries, lawyers, which increases the cost of transactions with goods/services for the user and lengthens their timing.

Analysis of sales markets is carried out in most cases by traditional methods and takes place at the expense of primitive surveys. This, in turn, leads to the fact that market participants do not have sufficiently accurate information about needs and intentions of buyers/sellers of goods and services.



## Issues under consideration and ways to solve them

From the *developers* point of view, the main drawbacks of the existing markets of turnover of goods (turnover of services) at the level of private users and small businesses can be identified as the following:

### Communication instability

Lack of unified norms of interpretation of laws and rules, technical problems of modern networks, increasing degree of state interference in market processes, other well-known problems of centralized systems.

Communicational instability, in its turn, leads to very negative consequences, limiting the potential of the existing system for further development - reduction of users' trust in the platforms providing services of exchange and purchase/sale of goods and services,   accumulation of technical errors, which inevitably lead to malfunction of the existing systems, supply chain disorders, the need to use the services of a vast class of intermediaries (lawyers, notaries, banks, courts), especially in case of different kinds of problems, the need to use the services of the intermediaries of the existing systems.

### High taxes and strict regulation in commodity turnover

Participation of small and medium businesses in commodity exchange operations results in inclusion by their representatives in the price of such goods of amounts of taxes and fees affecting ultimately the price of goods/services for the end consumer. As for participation of individuals in this sector, their activities are seriously restricted at the legislative level - exceeding the volume of transactions or limits of money turnover may lead to the procedure of recognizing such a market participant as a person in the status of entrepreneur without appropriate registration, with all the legal consequences arising from this.

### Excessive presence of intermediaries in the market

In the existing system, based on centralized regulation and control, there is a large layer of persons providing the widest range of services that can be conditionally referred to the class of intermediaries. It is impossible to make payments without using the modern banking system as an intermediary, it is often necessary to go through special registration procedures to participate in full-fledged barter transactions, and the emergence of disputes  and differences in the terms of contracts and agreements causes the involvement of additional actors in the relationship between the parties to the transaction - lawyers, escrow agents, notaries, the courts.

### Growing number of crypto-asset holders with limited ability to fully use them

In recent years, the number of Internet users, somehow connected with cryptocurrencies, is constantly growing. At the same time, user activity is limited to investment and trading activities, as full-fledged integration of crypto-assets into the existing markets is currently impossible, primarily due to the uncertainty of regulation of this industry at the interstate and state levels. A huge amount of crypto-assets are held by users in their wallets, without taking any  participation in the commodity turnover.

> **TODO**: Supplement with graphical information showing the growth of users of cryptocurrency markets (growth of accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, growth of the number of wallets, growth of trading volume of major cryptocurrency exchanges)

## Main objectives

Based on the understanding of the problems described earlier, the developers of the project set themselves the following tasks:


### Rationalization

Development of an application that rationalizes the existing system of intermediaries in trade transactions by automating most of the processes at the technical level, and making it easier for users to use Dapp to buy/sell goods and services.

### Practical usage of crypto-assets

Development of a system that would allow users to fully use crypto-assets as a means of payment/exchange, thus contributing to the popularization of crypto-assets and increasing their integration into modern markets of goods and services

### Transparent commercial activity

Development of a system that allows, in addition to the above, to analyze the commercial activity of users in order to improve market research methodologies and enable the identification of new markets.



## Technical facilities

These tasks will be solved in [Produktor.io]() by the following:

### Exchange calendar

The ability to temporarily plan the provision of goods/services by the user (downloading the information and the schedule of work/providing goods or services)

### Exchange map

Possibility of geolocation of goods/services delivery zone with indication of exact location or zone borders.

Additional features are:

* Product placement and publishing
* Local product searching
* Interactive map with editing abilities

### Use of decentralized cryptocurrencies

Providing user with the possibility of quick and guaranteed crypto-assets exchange when performing transactions in the application, or direct use of crypto-assets as a local means of payment.

### Object recognition system

The application will enable automatic detection and identification of goods/products from the image captured by a smartphone video camera, as well as recognition of significant properties and characteristics of the product using AI, such as:

- Product name (by photo)
- Product description (by name)
- Product images, video or other media
- Average price (zone-based analysis of online prices)

## Efficient data saving

* Decentralized data distribution
* Efficient data storage based on IPFS/SkyDB

### User-friendly user interface

Minimally simple, intuitive user interface using:

- **maps** - to display the location of the product/service.
- **calendar** - to determine when a product/service is available for purchase by users.
- a convenient system for specifying essential information about a product/service or essential terms of sale.
- **wish list** is a system that allows users to leave requests or requests for future availability of certain goods/services in areas specified by users. This system will allow sellers of goods/services to always respond to current market demands, as well as constantly improve the accuracy, completeness and reliability of statistical information about markets for market research and business analysis purposes.

## Services analyzing

One of the main functions of the application is also to improve accepted market analysis techniques by collecting and then analyzing the following information:

* Service or product search time for the user
* Service or product search zones
* Service or product delivery areas
* Place and time of periodic delivery (calendar) of the service or product
* Analysis of the intersection of the above indicators in order to accurately determine the current needs of market participants with respect to goods/services, their qualities, and the conditions of their provision to the user.

The formation of relevant data arrays will make it possible to subsequently provide this information to interested structures and organizations on a commercial basis, which will form one of the revenue items of the project budget.

It should be noted that most of the existing platforms and services providing some or other services related to crypto-assets do not provide the user with the possibility of full-fledged use of cryptocurrencies as a means of counter satisfaction for the provision of goods or services, limiting users' interaction with it exclusively to the investment or speculative trading framework. At the same time, even for such a limited scope of provided services, most of such services demonstrate significant *aggressiveness* in collection of personal information about the user, introducing complex and multistep procedures of user identity verification.

[Produktor.io]() is intended not only to enable its users to use their own crypto-assets as a means of payment for goods/services, but also to be able to do so with only as much personal information as determined by the user himself. The use of the cryptographic approach of a private and public key, and the system of exchange of users' public keys to confirm the validity and correctness of a transaction excludes the need to collect detailed information to verify the identity of the participants of such a
transaction.

Based on the above, you can determine the target audience of the project.

First, this category should include ordinary market participants (individuals) who wish to provide/receive services or sell/purchase goods not as part of commercial, but as part of everyday activities. The growth of the number of users of such platforms as [eBay](), [Amazon](), [AVITO]() and the like allows us to unambiguously determine the steady interest of this category for further growth and development of the sector.

Secondly, the target audience of the project is individual entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized businesses wishing to expand their customer base and the range of goods/services offered through the transfer of sales to the Internet space, or already conducting such activities. This category will be interested not only in the tools offered to analyze markets and build an effective commercial strategy, but also in the possibility of automated accounting of transactions and the formation of the necessary
supporting documentation, as well as accounting and tax reporting documents.

Finally, market players such as large trading companies, market research agencies, and business planning agencies constitute the part of the target audience that will be primarily interested in the data set generated from the analysis of the commercial activity of the application users and which is of primary interest in conducting market analysis, identifying new markets, and developing commercial strategies for development and expansion.

## Pricing model

As conceived by the developers, the main income items from the operation of the application will be formed as follows:

The following is a description of the basic functionality of the application, as well as the advanced functionality provided to paid categories of users.

According to the proposed business model, the main income items of the project will be:

### Fees

Transaction fees (thanks to a number of innovative technical solutions in blockchain, the application is able to perform transactions with minimal fees for the end user, which is one oc

### Markets supply

Implementation of data about demand/supply on markets, data about geographical and temporal distribution of user requests, other statistical information obtained from collection and analysis of data about application users' activity.

### Advertising

Placement of paid advertising content.


### Advanced functionality

Registration of paid users with access to the application's extended functionality.

### Enterprise support

Providing users with extended technical support services.

## Approximate distribution

The avg. distribution of future revenues by source of monetization:

![img_2.png](assets/diagrams/img_2.png)

Normal registration in the application (for all categories of users during the beta-testing period, for free accounts - after the full launch of the application) will give the user access to basic functionality, which includes the following features:

* Placement of information about offered goods/services.
* The system of determining the approximate price by searching for similar goods/services on the Internet and determining the average price indicators.
* Ability to identify goods by the following parameters:
  * ISDN.
  * Use of AI to identify goods/products by a photo taken by a user's smartphone camera.
  * Barcode.
  * QR-Code.
  * Through text analysis using OCR.
* Providing exchange of goods/services for crypto-assets:
  * Creating a transaction containing complete product/service information.
  * Distributed storage of information about the product/service and places of demand, as well as places of exchange, Accumulating information to analyze and understand markets
  * Maintenance of transactions through smart contracts.
* Performing product searches by category, globally on a map, or with preset search areas.
* Access to logistics services of specialized companies (locally and globally), without users without paying any additional fees.
* Management of cold wallets for the purpose of storage and exchange of crypto-assets by the user.

At the same time, in order to comply with current legislation, the application does not provide its own cold wallets, but only provides users with the ability to connect and use their wallets.

In the extended functionality, which the user is supposed to have access to, interaction with investors, sponsors, partners, negotiations, signing agreements and contracts.

* Project Manager support.
* Presentation of the project.
* preparation and signing of necessary investment agreements - in the interaction with the copywriter with paid accounts after the end of the beta-testing period, the following features are provided:

  * Automatic registration and storage of data on all performed transactions.
  * The possibility of automatic drawing up and keeping of accounting documents on the basis of data on operations, including automatic issuing of invoices on the fact of sales, automatic numbering of invoices, automatic registration of returns/replacement of goods.
  * Automatic preparation of tax reports on the basis of the automatic accounting data, enabling the user to make modifications in the manual mode.
  * **Important:** For users of their EU in the future you should also allow guest access to accounting data with commenting and approval rights - given the prevalence of hiring external accountants and tax advisers even at the private level, such an option will allow users to remain confident that their accounts are audited by their own advisers. Additionally, it will provide the application team with a reason to shift final responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of tax information to such
    consultants.
  * Enhanced market analysis capabilities.

>It is planned to introduce several levels of paid use, each of which will include all the functionality of the previous level plus extended functions or expanded scope of technical support.
