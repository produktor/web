## Technical facilities

The tasks arising from the main objectives will be solved in [Produktor.io]() by the following:

#### Exchange calendar

The ability to temporarily plan the provision of goods/services by the user (downloading the information and the schedule of work/providing goods or services)

#### Exchange map

Possibility of geolocation of goods/services delivery zone with indication of exact location or zone borders.

Additional features are:

* Product placement and publishing
* Local product searching
* Interactive map with editing abilities

#### Use of decentralized cryptocurrencies

Providing user with the possibility of quick and guaranteed crypto-assets exchange when performing transactions in the application, or direct use of crypto-assets as a local means of payment.

#### Object recognition system

The application will enable automatic detection and identification of goods/products from the image captured by a smartphone video camera, as well as recognition of significant properties and characteristics of the product using AI, such as:

- Product name (by photo)
- Product description (by name)
- Product images, video or other media
- Average price (zone-based analysis of online prices)

#### Efficient data saving

* Decentralized data distribution
* Efficient data storage based on IPFS/SkyDB

#### User-friendly user interface

Minimally simple, intuitive user interface using:

- **maps** - to display the location of the product/service.
- **calendar** - to determine when a product/service is available for purchase by users.
- a convenient system for specifying essential information about a product/service or essential terms of sale.
- **wish list** is a system that allows users to leave requests or requests for future availability of certain goods/services in areas specified by users. This system will allow sellers of goods/services to always respond to current market demands, as well as constantly improve the accuracy, completeness and reliability of statistical information about markets for market research and business analysis purposes.

### Services analyzing

One of the main functions of the application is also to improve accepted market analysis techniques by collecting and then analyzing the following information:

* Service or product search time for the user
* Service or product search zones
* Service or product delivery areas
* Place and time of periodic delivery (calendar) of the service or product
* Analysis of the intersection of the above indicators in order to accurately determine the current needs of market participants with respect to goods/services, their qualities, and the conditions of their provision to the user.

The formation of relevant data arrays will make it possible to subsequently provide this information to interested structures and organizations on a commercial basis, which will form one of the revenue items of the project budget.

It should be noted that most of the existing platforms and services providing some or other services related to crypto-assets do not provide the user with the possibility of full-fledged use of cryptocurrencies as a means of counter satisfaction for the provision of goods or services, limiting users' interaction with it exclusively to the investment or speculative trading framework. At the same time, even for such a limited scope of provided services, most of such services demonstrate significant *aggressiveness* in collection of personal information about the user, introducing complex and multistep procedures of user identity verification.

[Produktor.io]() is intended not only to enable its users to use their own crypto-assets as a means of payment for goods/services, but also to be able to do so with only as much personal information as determined by the user himself. The use of the cryptographic approach of a private and public key, and the system of exchange of users' public keys to confirm the validity and correctness of a transaction excludes the need to collect detailed information to verify the identity of the participants of such a
transaction.

Based on the above, you can determine the target audience of the project.

First, this category should include ordinary market participants (individuals) who wish to provide/receive services or sell/purchase goods not as part of commercial, but as part of everyday activities. The growth of the number of users of such platforms as [eBay](), [Amazon](), [AVITO]() and the like allows us to unambiguously determine the steady interest of this category for further growth and development of the sector.

Secondly, the target audience of the project is individual entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized businesses wishing to expand their customer base and range of goods/services offered by transferring sales to the Internet space, or already conducting such activities. This category would be interested not only in the proposed tools to analyze markets and build an effective commercial strategy, but also in the possibility of automated accounting of transactions and the formation of the necessary supporting documentation, as well as accounting and tax reporting documents.

Finally, market players such as large trading companies, market research agencies, and business planning agencies constitute the part of the target audience that will be primarily interested in the data set generated based on the analysis of the commercial activity of application users and of primary interest in conducting market analysis, identifying new markets, and developing commercial strategies for development and expansion.
