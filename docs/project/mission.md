# Main objectives

Below are the goals of the project arising from the pressing current problems of the crypto-world, as well as the world of exchange of things.

## Rationalization

Development of an application that rationalizes the existing system of intermediaries in trade transactions by
automating most of the processes at the technical level, and making it easier for users to use Dapp to buy/sell goods
and services.

## Practical usage of crypto-assets

Development of a system that would allow users to fully use crypto-assets as a means of payment/exchange, thus
contributing to the popularization of crypto-assets and increasing their integration into modern markets of goods and
services

## Transparent commercial activity

Development of a system that allows, in addition to the above, to analyze the commercial activity of users in order to
improve market research methodologies and enable the identification of new markets.
