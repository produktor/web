## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Question:

* What are the main differences between the [Produktor.io]() platform and existing similar platforms, such as Amazon or eBay?

#### Answer:

> 1. [Produktor.io]() is a fully and truly decentralized application for peer-to-peer exchange of services/goods directly between users; 
> 2. Thanks to the use of innovative solutions in [blockchain](https:/www.terafoundation.org), the application offers its users the lowest transaction fees compared to existing blockchain projects. It is also expected for a system of discounts depending on the user's rating to be introduced; 
> 3. The application is intended to cover the secondary market of goods and services, which currently does not have full-fledged platforms to function in full force. In addition, the emphasis on the development of Web3.0 ideas and the C2C paradigm makes the platform attractive to those users who have to use existing resources that do not provide the customer with full control and security guarantees;
> 4. Decentralization means that there is no corporate censorship at all. [Produktor.io]() is a platform without any hierarchy, where all movements, ratings, conditions are controlled only by the users themselves;
> 5. The integrated deal scheduler will allow the user not only to make one-time deals with the goods/available services he has, but also to build and control a system of periodic, regular deals;
> 6. Simplification of the user interface: the user can provide a description of his product/service in a video format, without having to fill out numerous forms. A product recognition function will help to automatically supplement product information with technical and other details;
> 7. Decentralized principle of the application functioning ensures the absence of a serious backend on the developer's side. All processes, including the formation and processing of transactions, take place on the user side with the allocation of data storage in the blockchain, which gives the latter full control and a guarantee of the safety of its data; 
> 9. If the user wishes, the application provides full anonymity: to use the platform, there is no need to provide personal data, including phone numbers or e-mail, and no need for 2FA. Specifying personal data is optional;
> 10. Due to the storage on the client side of all the information necessary to access the funds, the platform has no ability to control the users' funds at any time. This means that no blocking of funds on the accounts, hacker attacks or other interference in the status of the user's account is possible. 

#### Question:

* How will user funds be stacked in the application?

#### Answer:

> The app itself will not stake any user funds. They will be staked in users' own "cold" wallets, with [Produktor.io]() providing the ability to link such wallets to an account in the app. Thus, in essence, the user's funds will be controlled exclusively by the user at any given time, as access to the wallet in the form of a private and public key will always be stored in the browser on client's side. **NOTE!** The project team will provide a full range of consulting services and assistance to users in creating and linking wallets, when depositing and withdrawing funds, as part of the extended technical support programs. 

#### Question:

* How will the funds be credited to the user's account for use in transactions?

#### Answer:

> For the next exchange of crypto-assets for goods or services, the user has the opportunity to import the private key of his "cold" wallet by reading the QR-code in the browser. Then the user generates a new public key already in the personal cabinet and its funds are available for use within the application. 

#### Question:

* How will the funds be withdrawn?

#### Answer:

> To quickly and securely withdraw their funds to an external wallet, the user at any time will be able to make a transaction to an external wallet or third-party service for storing and exchanging crypto-assets, or export the key of the wallet tied to the account as a text file/pdf-file, or in QR-code format - this can be done directly from the browser.

#### Question:

* How can the user avoid being cheated in transactions?

#### Answer:

> 1. The user will be able to rate the counterparty thanks to the rating system. The relevance and timeliness of rating updates is guaranteed by the mandatory provision of feedback from users in relation to the parties to the transaction. 
> 2. Technical solutions regarding the formation and confirmation of transactions ensure the availability of the escrow element - this will allow users not to transfer funds until they confirm receipt of goods (confirmation of the transaction will be carried out, including by scanning QR codes automatically formed by the application for each transaction and for each of its participants. At the same time, the attempt to cheat the seller (non-payment of funds after receipt of goods/services) will be prevented by temporary blocking of the account, critical downgrades, limitation of functionality and other means provided by the platform.
